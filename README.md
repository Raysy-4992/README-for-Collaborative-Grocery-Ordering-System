## üöÄ Project Overview

This collaborative grocery ordering system was developed as part of my coursework at the University of Birmingham. Our team built a mobile application designed for students in shared housing, allowing them to create a single, unified grocery order.

As the **sole front-end developer**, I was responsible for designing and building the entire user interface from the ground up using Flutter and Dart. My work focused on creating a responsive, intuitive, and feature-rich experience for users.

Through this project, I researched and practised intensely to master the flutter framework and dart file type as I had limited prior experience. Flutter provided a powerful framework for building the UI. I spent time understanding the features of both including widgets state management. Through this, I was able to implement complex UI that contained scrollable grids, filtering and sorting functions and ensuring the UI worked on necessary platforms

## ‚ú® My Key Contributions & Features Implemented

**Sole Frontend Ownership:** Independently developed the complete client-side application, mastering the Flutter framework and Dart language within the project's timeline.
**Core Shared Cart Functionality:** Engineered the state management logic for a real-time shared shopping cart, allowing multiple users to collaboratively add and view items before a unified checkout.
**Dynamic UI Features:** Implemented complex UI for product browsing, including dynamic filtering by category and sorting logic (alphabetical, by price) to enhance usability.
**Clean & Maintainable Code:** Wrote clean, well-structured, and reusable Dart code (widgets and services) that simplified integration with the Supabase backend and ensured seamless data flow.
**Agile Collaboration & Version Control:** Utilized Git and a feature-branch workflow on GitHub to manage code changes, review pull requests, and collaborate effectively with backend and integration teammates.
